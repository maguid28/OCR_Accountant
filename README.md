# OCR Accountant

## Description
The purpose of this project is to develop an application that will allow the user to capture and store receipt data in an online database, while providing an easy-to-use platform to access this data. The application provides the user with insight into their purchase habits and will allow the user to view their purchase history through various representations. The aim is to provide the end user with a tool that will allow them to educate themselves in their own spending affairs as well as providing some insight in the form of statistical representations of their receipt data.
The application takes
advantage of tesseracts optical character recognition technology, while applying error
correcting algorithms for smoother input to capture obscured images.
This application
is designed for android mobile devices. It will run on Android devices running
Android 5.0 or higher, and works in conjunction with Googles Tesseract API as well
as the OpenCV API, to provide a simple and accurate experience for the user while
capturing receipt data. The user can then save their captured receipt securely to their
unique user account hosted by Amazon Web Services. The applicationâ€™s secondary
feature is to allow the user to view statistical data on their spending habits through the
use of various charts provided by the MPAndroidChart library.

For in depth details of the application please view the docs.
