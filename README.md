# OCR Accounting application

## General area covered by the project

  Image Processing

  Budgeting

  Management of income

## Description


#### Background:
  Found budgeting applications online

  None were too accurate as they required inputting the data manually.

  Had the idea of adding an OCR element to make input quicker and more efficient.

#### Achievements: What functions it provides, who its users will be
  Processes information on receipts/invoices/tickets

  Uses device camera and Optical Character Recognition with error correcting algorithms to capture obscured text for smoother input – user can capture image data more fluidly without having to worry if capture is perfect.

  Stores information in external SQL database to be manipulated in various ways

  Pulls information from emails for online purchases

               
  Calendar view:
  
    Display purchase information/statistics by day, month or year
      e.g. Amount spent on food on the 6th of August

      OR

      Difference in spending patterns since previous week

      Aimed at: Men and Women above 18 that would like to control and manage spending more effectively

#### Justification
  Allows users to monitor their spending habits on a day to day basis

  Gain control and manage income more effectively 

         
## Programming Languages to be used
  Java - as it is the main platform for android app development

  XML - for the UI layout

  SQL - for querying and updating the database

  PHP - Bridge connection between app and external SQL database
     
## Programming tools to be used
  Android studio

  Image Processor: with error correcting algorithms to capture obscured text for smoother input – user can capture receipt image quicker without having to worry if receipt is

  Database: Online database (SQL Server - rent Amazon server free for 12 months)
       
## Learning Challenges
  Main new technology I will have to learn is the image processing aspect of the project

  Learn how image correcting algorithms function to improve recognition of characters.

## Hardware/Software platform
  Developing the app for Android devices running 4.4 or higher

  Approximately 80% of users use 4.4 or higher

  This allows the app to function on a majority of populations devices while still keeping a majority of features.
